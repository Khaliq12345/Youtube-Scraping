# Youtube-Scraping
Scraping youtube with Selenium.

Web scraping is extracting data from websites. 
It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web into a central local database or spreadsheet for later analysis or retrieval.

Since YouTube is the biggest video-sharing website on the internet, extracting data can be very helpful. 
You can find the most popular channels, keep track of the popularity of channels, record likes and views on videos, and much more. 
This Project is based on extracting data from YouTube videos using Selenium webdriver and Pandas in Python.

Note that it isn't reliable to use this method to extract YouTube data, as YouTube keeps changing its code.
